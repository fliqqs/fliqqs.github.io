      <description>For this challenge I forget to take screenshots during the event so I am running it locally for this writeup. We are given the address of a website and the source code which if a flask web server.
After playing around with the card game for a bit I decided to dig around through the source code and see what stood out. After poking around I saw that an api was exposed, I took my a while to reach it as I forgot to add /api/ before trying to access the endpoints.</description>
