      <description>This was fun challenge that was apart of tjctf. We are given a server to connect to using netcat and a local copy of the binary. When connecting we are prompted to provide an input I though it might be a string format attack but had no luck.
So I fired it up in ghidra and had a poke around.
The main takeaway from the main function is that the binary looks for a flag and loads 0x19 bytes into local_38.</description>
