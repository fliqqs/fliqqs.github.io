      <description>Turtle Shell  Link to heading   For this challenge we are told to coerce a turtle to come out of its shell.
Poking around in ghidra we can see that our user input is taken and put in a buffer strstr is done against our input to check if bad is inside it. Then what is in the buffer is executed.
