We can see there is a string comparison with local_14 which is a string that resolves to &ldquo;hello_there&rdquo; so lets try that as arguments.">

<p>I decided to open up the application in ghidra and have a poke around. I saw that there was a red herring so I decided to chase it.</p>

<p>We can see there is a string comparison with local_14 which is a string that resolves to &ldquo;hello_there&rdquo; so lets try that as arguments.</p>
<p><img src="/images/secrets/args.png" alt="red_herring"></p>
<p>We can see that chasing the herring will get no where so lets have a look at some other functions. I did notice one called the_real_secret.</p>
<p><img src="/images/secrets/the_real_secret.png" alt="real_secret"></p>
<p>This certainly looks alot more interesting but there are no function calls to this method. Lets fire up GDB and call it ourselves. I also have and extension called gef installed, I recommend it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/secrets/gdb.png" alt="real_secret"></p>
<p>The last step was to decode the ascii dump.</p>
<p><img src="/images/secrets/cyberchef.png" alt="real_secret"></p>
<p>This was a cool one for me as I learnt that you can call functions with GDB.</p>
